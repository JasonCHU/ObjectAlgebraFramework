\textbf{Object Algebras. } B. Oliveira and W. Cook proposed Object Algebra as a solution to Expression Problem. 

\textbf{Scrap Your Boilerplate. } R. Lammel and S. P. Jones presented a design pattern to traverse data structure of recursive data types in haskell. Such programs usually have much "`boilerplate"' code as we have in our object algebra tree structures. 

\textbf{Visitor Combinators. } J. Visser introduced vistor combinators to compose new visitors from given ones. 

\textbf{Almost Compositional Functions. }
