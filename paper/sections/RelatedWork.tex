\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

To the best of our knowledge, few work has been done addressing writing generic queries and transformations with object algebras, while we should mention some work on object algebras and large tree structures traversal control, which inspired and formed the basis of our work. 

\textit{Object Algebras}. Oliveira proposed Object Algebras as a solution to Expression Problem. Object algebras applies well in mainstream object oriented languages like Java. It is a lightweight solution in terms of language features required. Oliveira also worked on using intersection type and type-constructor polymorphism to make object algebras compositional with feature oriented programming. Different from their prior research, we found that when applying object algebras in rich tree structures, boilerplate code is hard to avoid. Hence our work focuses on reducing the amount of boilerplate code for developers when writing queries and transformations with object algebra tree structures. 

\textit{Tree structures traversals}. In the functional programming community like Haskell, much research has been done on traversal control of large structures. Lammel's Scrap your Boilerplate\cite{ralf03syb} series introduced a practical design pattern for generic programming in tree structures, which inspired our work of scrapping boilerplates in Object Algebras. Bringert\cite{bjorn08acf} introduced useful compositional functions to help construct final results in Haskell. Lammel\cite{ralf00banana} proposed a polytypic programming approach for generalized and basic folds. These fold algebras scale up applications involving large systems of mutually recursive datatypes. These works all try to optimize traversal control of large structures in functional programming paradigm, while our work solves a similar problem in Object Algebras, a programming style in Object Oriented Programming paradigm. 

\textit{Visitor Combinators and Traversal Control}. Visser\cite{visser01visitor} provided some visitor combinators that can express interesting traversal strategies in visitor pattern. We applies some similar idea like identity transformation in simple transformation, but our work targets at traversal control in Object Algebras. 

In summary, prior to our work, research has been done on object algebras and composition problem of this programming style. In the functional programming world and with visitor pattern, traversal control in large structures is also explored. Different from these work, we explored techniques helping write generic queries and transformations traversing large tree structures with Object Algebras.
