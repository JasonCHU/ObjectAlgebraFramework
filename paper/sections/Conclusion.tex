\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper showed how various types of traversals for complex
structures can be automatically provided by \Name. \name traversals are
written directly in Java and are type-safe, extensible and separately
compilable. There has always been a tension between the 
correctness guarantees of static typing, and the flexibility of
untyped/dynamically-typed approaches. \name shows that even
in type systems like Java's, it is possible to get considerable
flexibility and adaptability for the problem of boilerplate code in
traversals of complex structures, without giving up modular static typing. 
%\name offers the best of both worlds: the
%static typing guarantees; and flexibility and adaptability.

There are many of avenues for future work. One area of research is to
extend \name traversals to support flexible traversal strategies,
similarly to strategic
programming~\cite{borovansky1996elan,visser1998core,vandenBrand:2003:TRT:941566.941568}. Another
line of work worth exploring is to adopt generalizations of object
algebras~\cite{oliveira13fop} for added expressiveness of \name
traversals.
