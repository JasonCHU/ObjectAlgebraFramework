Typo, hyphenation, reference. (Fixed)
Some figures moved.

Analysing the conciseness that Shy improves in terms of number of classes and methods. (TODO)

* Section 1. Introduction.
Contributions of the paper: added a new item "Applications and examples".

* Section 2. Background: Object Algebras
Client code shown at the end of this section.

* Section 3. An Overview of Shy.
Example of the renaming updated: before we just renamed all variables with "_" suffixed;
now we specify a variable to be renamed, and all the occurrences of it are renamed with
a new name.

* Section 4. Queries.
At the end of 4.3: the case when empty() is invoked is added to the template.

* Section 5. Generalized Queries.
Explanation of why StatAlg doesn't extend ExpAlg.

* Section 6. Transformations.
Invocation of SubstVar shows how transformations are used.

* Section 8. Desugaring Transformations.
A new section: desugaring transformations describes how Shy is applied to implement
compositional desugarings in a type-safe and extensible manner.

* Section 9. Extensible Queries and Transformations.
Classified into "Linear Extensibility" and "Independent Extensibility".
The new subsection "Independent Extensibility" shows symmetric extension of the transformation.

* Section 10. Shy Implementation.
A new section briefly introducing Shy framework as a library.

* Section 11. Case Study.
Figures of performance testing updated.
11.3: added a paragraph describing where the QL programs come from.

* Section 12. Related Work.
A new paragraph: Eliminating Boilerplate in Design Patterns, citing Hannemann & Kiczales OOPSLA' 02 paper.
