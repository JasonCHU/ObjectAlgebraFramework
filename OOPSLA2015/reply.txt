We thank all the reviewers for the nice comments and we try 
to address the main concerns/questions next. All other comments
will be addressed in the revision of the paper.

* Hyphenation

We apolegize for the hyphenation! We will fix it in the final 
version.

* Is boilerplate generation implemented? If so, how?

Reviewers B&C ask about the implementation of Shy.  Shy is implemented
using the javax annotation processor, which is part of the
SDK. Because javax annotations are standard the integration with IDE's
like Eclipse is quite good.  In a project usign Shy, the generated
code lives under packages called "query" and "transform".

#reviewer B

"what's the code size difference between the Vanilla and Shy solutions?"

Tijs?

#reviewer C

"Are top-down traversals supported and how are the desugaring transformations implemeneted?"

Tijs?

"Would Scala traits make the approach more compositional?" 

Regarding extensibility, we can currently get quite far with Java 8
using interfaces with default methods. Using default methods allows us
to get quite a few of of the benefits of multiple-inheritance and
traits. Ofcourse if we had traits we could do some things more
elegantly.

"Origins of strategic programming are misrepresented"

Thanks for pointing it out. We will fix this!
